# Portfolio Project

## About this project
- My idea here is to create a portfolio as a showcase of my work which ideally will co-insign with my CV

- i have used:
1. React
2. React-Icons

## My project journey

- I first started this project by doing the set-up stuff first, i had mocked up ideas of components i wanted and added them into a seperate folder, and focused on getting them set up and displayed on the screen

- Next, i decided and with the help of a tutorial i felt that using CSS variables would be a good feature to impliment, having not really used them before and knowing i wanted to repeat a lot of CSS values to keep it consistent throughout, it would save time in the long run

- From here i began creating and coding the header section, which involed creating two more seperate components within that file, for buttons and social tabs.
