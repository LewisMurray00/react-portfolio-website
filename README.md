# Portfolio Project

## About this project
- My idea here is to create a portfolio as a showcase of my work which ideally will co-insign with my CV

- i have used:
1. React
2. React-Icons

## My project journey

- I first started this project by doing the set-up stuff first, i had mocked up ideas of components i wanted and added them into a seperate folder, and focused on getting them set up and displayed on the screen

- Next, i decided and with the help of a tutorial i felt that using CSS variables would be a good feature to impliment, having not really used them before and knowing i wanted to repeat a lot of CSS values to keep it consistent throughout, it would save time in the long run

- From here i began creating and coding the header section, which involed creating two more seperate components within that file, for buttons and social tabs.

- After the header section, i moved onto the Navbar. where i created a fixed 'floating' Navbar that exists in the centre of the screen and scrolls down as the user does. It uses UseState hook to change the active class allowing some css used for the class that has been selected 

- Next i turned my focus to the About section, it was here that i created cards (which i may refactor as a seperate component) to highlight some key things about me as well as a paragraph and also reusing a button to contact me

## Plans for the future

- Refactor cards as an individual component in the About.jsx
- Refactor CSS names in experience rather than using children to find
